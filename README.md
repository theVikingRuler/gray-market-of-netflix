#Netflix
Netflix offers mainly five categories of subscription plans: Mobile, Basic, Standard with Ads, Standard, and Premium Plans. Many regions do not enjoy Mobile plan. Basic and Standard with Ads plans are supplements as they do not coexist in any region.
The price and plans csv consists six columns: country code, country name, mobile plan pricing, basic/standard with ads plan pricing, standard plan pricing, and premium plan pricing. Each plan is in USD. The conversions from local currencies to USD were calculated on the basis of Google Exchange Rate on 15 October, 2025.
